# SimpleSort Bookmarks

Do you need to keep your Firefox bookmark library sorted so you can find your
bookmarks faster?
Me too, so I made this addon.

I also need to avoid to sort the "ToRead" folder I use for short lived bookmarks.
I like to keep them sorted by time because I can easyly access the last ones. So
I added the blacklist.

The plans for this addon is to stay as simple and clean as possible from the
side of the user but also from the side of the developer. This means not too
many options and avoid to add too much features.

## Getting started

At first run a page will open to allow the initial setup.

1. Before using this addon you may want to backup your bookmark library.
2. You may add a bookmark folder to the blacklist of the not to be sorted folders.
3. If your bookmarks are a mess you can sort all your library. In case you
    skipped step one, the addon will remember you to backup before starting the
    sorting.

Other options are available in the addons preferences page in the "Extensions"
section of Firefox.

## Features list

- Sort bookmarks automatically when the user adds, edits or moves an item.
- Sort by title, url or date and optionally display folders before bookmarks.
- Optional panel button to open the advanced options page.
- Sort all the bookmarks library.
- Blacklist for bookmark folders not to be sorted.

## Warnings

Backup!
This addon will sort every folder not in the blacklist. If you dont like the
new order the only way to revert to the previous situation is to restore from
your backup. There isn't an "undo" feature in this addon and the backup is only
two clicks away.
I warmly recommend to save you bookmarks before proceeding.

For now the settings are not synchronized with your Firefox account. If you
install this addon on multiple devices, remember to configure the blacklisted
folder in each installation.

If you are using another addon that moves or changes automatically the bookmarks
there is a probability they will conflict. For example if you are testing two
addons for automatic bookmark sorting they will probably try to sort each other
actions untill the end of time.
